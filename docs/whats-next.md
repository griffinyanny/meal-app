# What's Next

Last updated: 2026-07-08 (Session 16)

## Exact Status
- **Phase**: Phase 1C (Plan Tab) — the design-led build pass is COMPLETE. All three Session 15 backlog items built (regenerate entry point, "AI is working" affordance, drawer dismissal), a high-effort dual review found + fixed 4 correctness bugs, and the gauntlet + production build are green (173/173 tests, +6 this session).
- **Session 16**: ux-design-critic designed the two app-wide patterns before building. Built: (1) regenerate/new-plan entry point via `intentMode` (re-prompts through the intent screen; no confirm dialog — the intent screen is the airlock) + a new elapsed-plan "week wrapped" state; (2) the in-place, scroll-independent AI-working affordance (MealCard `working`/`justChanged`, sheets stay open and close on success, bottom ack/error pills, optimistic `setData`, reusable `usePlanModify` hook, reachable error/retry); (3) drawer cleanup (shared X in `DrawerContent`, click-outside scrim that never touches body pointer-events, focus order). Dual review fixed: stale-modify-over-regenerate (token guard), removed-day highlight/scroll, global-pending-leaking-into-sheets (source scoping), stale pills over intent/streaming. Extracted `BottomBar`, removed dead `DrawerOverlay`.
- **Where the branch is**: `session-15-plan-fixes` — see "Branch / deploy" below for whether this session merged/pushed it.

## ⚠️ Manual verification Griffin still needs to run
No browser tool was available in Session 16, so the live UI was NOT click-tested (only lint/typecheck/tests/build/review). Run these in the app (dev server: `PORT=3001 npm run dev`, then the DevTools signin snippet):

1. **Test 8 — regenerate over an existing plan (the unblocked test).** With a plan present: draft → tap "Start over →"; confirmed → tap "Plan a new week →". Confirm it lands on the intent screen (pills + textarea), that a confirmed plan shows the "…will replace this week's meals" line, that "← Keep current plan" returns you, and that generating streams a NEW plan replacing the old one. Then confirm the old plan is gone (one-active-plan).
2. **Elapsed-plan state.** With a confirmed plan whose days are all in the past, confirm you get "That's a wrap on this week…" + thumbs recap + "Plan next week →" (not the old nonsensical mid-week view). Thumbs should still persist to chef memory.
3. **AI-working affordance on every modify path.** (a) inline card chip → the card dims + "Reworking {day}'s dinner…" + shimmer, then the new content lands with a highlight ring; (b) expanded-sheet action → sheet stays open showing pending, closes on success onto the changed card; (c) meal-scoped chat → same; (d) whole-week "Talk to the Chef" ("make this week lighter") → sheet pending, then a bottom pill with the chef's sentence that taps to scroll to the changed day. Confirm there is NO top-of-page toast anymore and no silent change.
4. **⭐ Drawer click-outside (highest-risk, un-click-tested).** Open each sheet (expanded + Talk-to-Chef) and tap the dimmed area outside it — it should close. Confirm this did NOT reintroduce the two-drawer pointer-events lockup (open a sheet, close via outside-tap, then tap a card — the card must still open). Also confirm the X still works and drag-to-dismiss still works. Note: background scroll while a sheet is open is now blocked by the scrim (accepted trade for click-outside — flag if you dislike it).
5. **Error path.** If you can force a modify failure (or just eyeball the code path): inline-chip failure → bottom "That didn't take — try again?" pill with Retry; sheet failure → the sheet stays open with the retry line.

## Branch / deploy — pick up here
- **Merge/push**: `session-15-plan-fixes` (now carries Session 15 + Session 16). If not yet merged, merge to `main` + push (gauntlet + build + dual-review green).
- **Vercel deploy**: prod still on the pre-1B scaffold. Needs `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in Vercel env + a redeploy. This is outward-facing — do it after the manual pass above (or on Griffin's go-ahead). Env source: the Anthropic/OpenAI dashboards → 1Password (see `reference_env_secrets`).

## Known deviation
- `plan-page-client.tsx` is 330 lines (30 over the 300 rule). Every cohesive unit was already extracted; the rest is controller wiring + a render switch. Deliberately not split further (would mean a 20-prop presenter child). Overrule if you want it split.

## Key Files (Plan tab, post-Session-16)
- `src/components/plan/plan-page-client.tsx` — orchestrator (state + wiring + render switch)
- `src/components/plan/use-plan-modify.ts` — the AI-working affordance state machine (pending/changedDates/ack/error + token guard). Reusable by future tabs.
- `src/components/plan/meal-card.tsx` — `working`/`justChanged` props + `data-meal-date` scroll hook
- `src/components/plan/week-wrapped-state.tsx`, `past-meal-row.tsx`, `bottom-bar.tsx`, `modify-status-pills.tsx` — new
- `src/components/plan/expanded-meal-sheet.tsx`, `talk-to-chef-sheet.tsx` — sheets (stay open during modify)
- `src/components/ui/drawer.tsx` — shared X + click-outside scrim + focus order
- `src/app/api/plan/stream/route.ts` — streaming generation (replace-on-generate)
- `src/server/trpc/routers/plan.ts` — modify now returns `changedDates`
- `src/app/globals.css` — `.shimmer-bar` + `.animate-highlight-ring` keyframes

## Login on localhost (solved — don't rediscover)
- Google OAuth works on localhost:3001: Supabase Redirect URLs include it AND the proxy recognizes chunked cookies.
- If "sign-in loops back to /login" recurs: check cookie chunking first (`sb-*-auth-token.0/.1` vs the proxy regex in `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`).

## Development Workflow (established Session 8)
- Claude builds autonomously — don't stop for every change; check in when something cool is ready; only block on key product decisions.
- Codex QA / dual review at core milestones — mandatory. Run `/code-review` at the end of every build phase.
- Continuously ask "Is this how a senior engineer would build this?" Run the gauntlet (lint + typecheck + test + build) proactively.

## Open Questions Remaining
1. Free-form vs. structured list entry for Groceries (resolve during 1D)
2. AI-first preferences vs. static settings for You tab (resolve during 1E)
3. `recipe.get` returns `null` for missing recipes while `favorite`/`delete` throw NOT_FOUND — inconsistent; align during a 1D touch of the recipe router.
4. Working-label contextuality: currently day-level ("Reworking Tuesday's dinner…"). Verb-level ("Making it spicier…") was deferred as brittle; `workingLabel()` has a hook to enrich later if desired.
5. `scopedRequest` is a natural-language suffix, not a structural anchor — move to a structured `plan.modify` target if scoping proves unreliable.
